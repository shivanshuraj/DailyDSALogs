BIG MISTAKE: I couldn't solve Max subarray question because I recalled old step and didn't think logically. This is a really bad practice and I'll have to pay for it. Remember that.

Today I solved and reviewed old dsa questions staring from the beginning. I have started preparing for TCS NQT of 26th April.
Apart from above, I solved reverse arr, and sum of max, min of an array.
