BIG MISTAKE: I couldn't solve Max subarray question because I recalled old step and didn't think logically. This is a really bad practice and I'll have to pay for it. Remember that.

Today I learnt: There can be thousands of ways to solve a problem and thousands more to optimise it. Even if you can save a small operation you can save some ms. Like in some cases, HashSet is better than Hashmap. Even when using HashSet, you can use add() instead of contains() since it will save an extra operation of adding the element to the set. WOW. Further more, If you can handle special base cases, that will optimize it even more. FANTASTIC!.

Today I solved and reviewed old dsa questions staring from the beginning. I have started preparing for TCS NQT of 26th April.
Apart from above, I solved reverse arr, and sum of max, min of an array, contains duplicate.
